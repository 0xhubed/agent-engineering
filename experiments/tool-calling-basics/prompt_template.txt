You have access to the following tools:

<tools>
{tool_definitions}
</tools>

When you need to call a tool, use this exact format:

<tool_call>
{"name": "tool_name", "arguments": {"arg1": "value1"}}
</tool_call>

If you need to call multiple tools, use multiple <tool_call> blocks.
Only call tools when needed. Otherwise, respond normally.
