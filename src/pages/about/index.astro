      <p>
        Agent Engineering is a practitioner's reference for building AI agents — covering architecture patterns,
        context management, tool use, multi-agent orchestration, retrieval, safety, and evaluation.
        It is written for engineers who are building these systems in production, not for researchers
        reading about them in theory.
      </p>

      <h2>What's here</h2>

      <p>
        The site is organized around two content types. <strong>Topics</strong> are deep-dive reference
        articles on foundational patterns — ReAct, memory systems, prompt caching, the Skills Pattern,
        MCP, A2A, agentic RAG, and more. Each topic includes prose explanation, architecture diagrams,
        and Python code examples using LangChain/LangGraph or the Microsoft Agent Framework.
        <strong>Dispatches</strong> are shorter news items surfaced daily from the field — new research,
        framework releases, and protocol updates.
      </p>

      <h2>How it stays current</h2>

      <p>
        The news feed is maintained automatically by an AI agent. Every day, a GitHub Actions workflow
        runs a Python script that fetches RSS feeds from Anthropic, LangChain, OpenAI, Google AI,
        and Hugging Face. The raw items are passed to Claude, which filters for relevance to agent
        engineering, writes a one-sentence summary for each, and returns a ranked JSON list.
        That list is committed directly to the repository as <code>src/data/news.json</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The commit triggers an automatic redeployment on Vercel. Within a few minutes of the workflow
        completing, the homepage and Resources page reflect the day's most relevant developments —
        with no manual editing involved.
      </p>

      <h2>How articles are added</h2>

      <p>
        New articles are generated using <code>scripts/add-article.py</code>, a CLI tool that accepts
        a topic string, a URL, a pasted tweet, or raw notes. It calls Claude with web search enabled,
        which researches the topic and writes a full newspaper-style MDX article — 800 to 1,500 words
        of flowing prose, with architecture diagrams, code examples, and callouts. The output is saved
        directly to the content collection and optionally committed in a single command.
      </p>

      <h2>The stack</h2>

      <p>
        The site is built with <a href="https://astro.build" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astro</a> and
        <a href="https://tailwindcss.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tailwind CSS</a>,
        deployed on <a href="https://vercel.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vercel</a>.
        Content is stored as MDX files in an Astro content collection. The automation runs on
        GitHub Actions. All AI calls use the
        <a href="https://www.anthropic.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthropic API</a>
        with Claude.
